Kobayashi is my take on small, fast, easy-to-use blog engine for ruby
developers. It uses simple markdown posts, git operations and hosts on
heroku and slots directly into any developer's natural dev flow.

Interested? You can [read more on the About page](/about)

It's meant to handle large numbers of posts easily and still be fast as
well as has heavy caching to provide the near-resilience of static sites
without the overhead of pre-generation. Nice stuff like code
highlighting, future posts and asset optimization are built-in, so after
initial setup, all you need to do is write posts and `rake deploy` to have
everything pushed up instantly.

That's all.
