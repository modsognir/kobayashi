Well, might as well check to see if this works the way it's advertised.
Ideally, you should *never* see this post (unless you're looing at this
in some sort of Futurama or Buck Rogers scenario), even though you'll be
missing it's funky highlighted syntax.

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

OK then. To the future! Huzzah!!
